# [Published in Biotropica] Using the Area of Habitat to Assess the Extent of Protection of India’s Birds


India hosts multiple global biodiversity hotspots while being one of the most populous countries
Here, we examine how well India has protected its avifauna, based on the fraction of their ranges
falling within ‘protected areas’. India has protected 5% of its land this way. At issue is whether
India has done better than expected in protecting its threatened species. To this end, we assessed
99 Near Threatened, Threatened and small-ranged species by estimating their Area of Habitat
(AOH). We refined published species ranges using secondary information on elevation limits
and habitat preferences. More than half (52) of the species assessed have their AOH <30% of
their published ranges, while 31 have <10%. India has protected 87 threatened species’ AOH
more than expected (>5%), and for 33 species, the proportion protected exceeds the Aichi target
(>17%). When we considered the top 10% richest regions as hotspots, only 9.2% of their total
area falls under India’s protected area network, inadequately covering areas with most threatened
birds. We also discuss the conservation concerns for grassland and open habitat species across
India, since we find that substantial proportions of their AOHs fall outside protected areas. This
result highlights the significance of alternative conservation models, including other effective
area-based conservation measures. We show that species’ AOH provides a more realistic well-
informed range that can aid in assessing their protection status
